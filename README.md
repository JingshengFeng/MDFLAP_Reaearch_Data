The research data in manuscript “Multiperiod Location-allocation Network Design with Capacity Expansion Strategy and Inpatient Discharge for Emergency Medical Facilities”.

We employ Google Maps to pick up the latitude and longitude of the point of interest. The capacity is the number of available beds in each facility; the comprehensive area type of facility is converted from a large exhibition center for emergencies. The time-varying demand in each period is predicted by tailored LSTM model. Table B.1 and Table B.2 summarize the information for each MCH and district in S City.
